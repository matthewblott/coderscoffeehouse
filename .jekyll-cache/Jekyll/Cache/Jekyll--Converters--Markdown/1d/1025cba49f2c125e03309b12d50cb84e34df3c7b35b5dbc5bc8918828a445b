I"<p>I submitted a <a href="http://coderscoffeehouse.com/tech/2015/10/13/dotnet-needs-more-languages.html">post</a> about the lack of variety of languages for the .NET platform and mentioned the Iron languages project which includes <a href="http://ironpython.net">IronPython</a>. This project was originally sponsored by Microsoft but dropped sometime around 2010 but has managed to keep going even though most havenâ€™t heard too much about it. With .NET now with official mutli platform support I thought now would be a good time to have a look at this member of the Python family - .NET has some great libraries and would certainly appeal to a seasoned .NET developer like myself. But I noticed the last release was December 2014 - almost a year ago. There is talk on the blog of Python 3 support but I could see very little <a href="https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3">activity</a> on Github for this either. Has IronPython like its sister project <a href="http://ironruby.net">IronRuby</a> now become abandonware?</p>
