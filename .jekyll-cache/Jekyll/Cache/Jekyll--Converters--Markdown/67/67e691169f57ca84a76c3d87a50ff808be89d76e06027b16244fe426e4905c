<p>A quick post this one but like my others it’s a useful personal documentation exercise for an issue I’ve had to deal with. Mono runs pretty smoothly on Linux but having used it for a while it’s apparent to me that .NET is a second class citizen on Linux. And as such I came across a <a href="http://mono.1490590.n4.nabble.com/Anyone-having-SqlDataAdapter-problems-with-4-2-1-td4667001.html">truly horrible and shocking bug</a>
quite recently on version 4.2.1. (Essentially the bug causes a crash every time the Fill method of the SqlDataAdapater is called - one of the most routine and basic operations a .NET developer is likely to perform. This would never have happened on the Windows version and underlines how Xamarin are more concerned with enterprise mobile than .NET on Linux but that’s a post for another day.)</p>

<p>First Mono needs to be completely removed from the system which is done by running the following commands.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get remove mono-complete
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get purge mono-complete
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get autoremove
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then update the source list with the version you wish to install by running the following command (replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x.x.x</code> of the code snippet below with the version number you wish to install - in my case it was 4.0.5).</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"deb http://download.mono-project.com/repo/debian wheezy/snapshots/x.x.x main"</span> | <span class="nb">sudo tee</span> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mono-xamarin.list
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally run update and install the mono packages as shown below.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get update
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get <span class="nb">install </span>mono-devel
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get <span class="nb">install </span>mono-complete
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>And that’s it. Pretty simple :-)</p>
