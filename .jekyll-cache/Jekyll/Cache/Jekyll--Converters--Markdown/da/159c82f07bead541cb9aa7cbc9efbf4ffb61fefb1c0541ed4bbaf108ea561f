I"Ö<p>Welcome to my brand new blog. This is the place where I will be sharing my ideas and tutorials on stuff related to my day job.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been answering questions and submitting comments to techie blogs for some time and reckon it makes more sense to concentrate my efforts on something like this. I also get to play with various technologies which I love doing but working with new things can be a challenge so I thought it made sense to have a resource where I could document the solutions Iâ€™ve come up with for particular problems. Hopefully some who read this will find what I put here useful as well.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it for this first post - itâ€™s good to be up and running at last! Enjoy :-)</p>

<p>Matt</p>
