I've read Douglas Crockford's 'Good Parts' and made serious attempts to like JavaScript but failed each time. It's not the dynamic feature - I thought it might be but then I started coding with Ruby and Python and found I really like both. Possibly it's the context switching after working with server side languages - I find the endless callbacks in code weird to work with. But the biggest problem (which you allude to in your comments) is the attempt to force a classic OO paradigm onto a language that has the very different prototypical inheritance. The result of this is with a big project you end up with a mixture of the two and it's hard to follow. Angular 2 and TypeScript are trying to make it easier for those coming from server side C languages and at first it doesn't seem so bad but as soon as you hit a problem and are looking at a third party library you'll be working with idiomatic JavaScript.
