Create a directory for our project

dotnet mkdir nancy_demo
cd nancy_demo

There's no templates available for Nancy for .NET Core 2.0 but the beauty of Nancy is it's so simple that a starter template really is no more than a couple of files.

We need to add a few dependencies which we can do with the ```dotnet``` command but first we need a ```.csproj``` file.

vim nancy_demo.csproj

Copy and paste the following then save with ```!wq``` if you're using ```vim``` like me.

<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>


Now add those dependencies.

dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Owin
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel
dotnet add package Nancy -v 2.0.0-clinteastwood

Create the ```Startup``` class.

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Nancy.Owin;

namespace nancy_demo
{
  public class Startup
  {
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
      app.UseOwin(x => x.UseNancy());
    }
  }
}

Create the ```Program``` class as our entry point.

using System.IO;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;

namespace nancy_demo
{
  public class Program
  {
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      var host = new WebHostBuilder()
        .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
        .UseKestrel()
        .UseStartup<Startup>()
        .Build();

      host.Run();
    }
  }
}

Anyone's who's been working with ASP.NET Core will find the above familiar. The process for running is much the same but with a lot less boilerplate!

Lastly create a module for serving some requests. This takes the form of a class which inherits from ```NancyModule```.

using Nancy;

namespace nancy_demo
{
  public class HomeModule : NancyModule
  {
    public HomeModule()
    {
      Get("/", args => "Hello World!");
    }
  }
}

Now from the terminal enter ```dotnet run``` and ... that's it!

If you go to your browser and browse to ```localhost:5000``` you should see the following.
