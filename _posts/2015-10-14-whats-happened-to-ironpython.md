I [submitted a post](http://coderscoffeehouse.com/tech/2015/10/13/dotnet-needs-more-languages.html) about the lack of variety of languages for the .NET platform and mentioned the Iron languages project which includes IronPython. This project was originally sponsored by Microsoft but dropped sometime around 2010 but has managed to keep going even though most haven't heard too much about it. With .NET now with official mutli platform support I thought now would be a good time to have a look at this member of the Python family - .NET has some great libraries and would certainly appeal to a seasoned .NET developer like myself. But I noticed the last release was December 2014 - almost a year ago. There is talk on the blog of Python 3 support but I could see very little activity on Github for this either. Has IronPython like its sister project IronRuby now become abandonware?
