Welcome to my brand new blog. This is the place where I will be sharing my ideas and tutorials on stuff related to my day job.

I've been answering questions and submitting comments to techie blogs for some time and reckon it makes more sense to concentrate my efforts on something like this. I also get to play with various technologies which I love doing but working with new things can be a challenge so I thought it made sense to have a resource where I could document the solutions I've come up with for particular problems. Hopefully some who read this will find what I put here useful as well.

That's it for this first post - it's good to be up and running at last! Enjoy :-)

Matt
